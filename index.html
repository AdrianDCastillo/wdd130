        <p> Hello, my name is Adrian del Castillo. I am from Cochabamba, Bolivia. I am passionate about computer
            technology and
            programming. Here I have studied biomedical engineering. I have some knowledge related to programming,
            especially the
            language in Python, but I love everything that is web programming. Some other hobbies that I have are
            playing
            basketball, playing soccer, and I also love jogging and going to the gym to clear my mind. I am very excited
            to face the
            opportunity to study web design through HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Thank you very much.</p>
